# University Projects
Greetings 👋

My name is Ainhoa and this repository will contain projects I've completed, and those I'm currently working on for my University classes. After finishing my projects, I will upload their code and an image showcasing the end result.

This is my first attempt at better documenting my progress and capturing lessons learned, so I ask that you be kind and keep in mind that I'm still learning 👩🏼‍💻😀.
