# University Projects
Greetings 👋

My name is Ainhoa and this repository will contain projects I've completed, and those I'm currently working on for my University classes. After finishing my projects, I will upload their code and an image showcasing the end result.

This is my first attempt at better documenting my progress and capturing lessons learned, so I ask that you be kind and keep in mind that I'm still learning 👩🏼‍💻😀.

## Getting Started
To explore the projects and code:
  1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
  2. Open the projects in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode).
  3. Dive into the code and experiment with your own modifications.
   
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions. Happy coding!

## Pokemon
In this project, I aimed to ensure the proper formation of HTML and CSS files while focusing on the optimization of common resources such as CSS and images. I worked to avoid orphaned links and used optimized images to balance size and weight for web efficiency. Additionally, I prioritized correct and logical linking between different HTML files to create a cohesive and well-structured web experience.
The classes in the HTML code are named in Spanish because the course was conducted in Spanish. However, I've made some changes to the code to ensure that everyone can understand the story in English.
