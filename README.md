# University Projects
Greetings 👋

My name is Ainhoa and this repository will contain projects I've completed, and those I'm currently working on for my University classes. After finishing my projects, I will upload their code and an image showcasing the end result.

This is my first attempt at better documenting my progress and capturing lessons learned, so I ask that you be kind and keep in mind that I'm still learning 👩🏼‍💻😀.

In this project, I aimed to ensure the proper formation of HTML and CSS files while focusing on the optimization of common resources such as CSS and images. I worked to avoid orphaned links and used optimized images to balance size and weight for web efficiency. Additionally, I prioritized correct and logical linking between different HTML files to create a cohesive and well-structured web experience.
